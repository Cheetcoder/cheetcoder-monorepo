## Course Material

- **Course Website** - I will be posting reference material here and anything that I think would be beneficial for your journey. 

- **Course Materials.** You can access everything you need for this class through Github: [https://github.com/orgs/Cheetcoder/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Cheetcoder/repositories) 

- [**Grokking the coding interview Course**](https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-the-coding-interview/) **.** This course material is great for engineers who have previously gone through a data structures course and just want to start grinding immediately. Also, these questions are more likely the ones that will be asked during your interview! We will start to cover this course during week 1.

- [**System Design Interview Book**](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/)- This book will cover everything you need to know for a System Design interviews.

- [**The Tech Resume Inside Out Book**](https://thetechresume.com/)- A practical guide written by the people who do the resume screening: engineering managers and recruiters working at tech companies.



## Course Structure

- **The Approach.** The approach will be to go through around 200+ Algorithm problems that are commonly asked in FANG type interviews in a systematic way. This won't be your typical, instructor led course but an adult reverse classroom with mentors from the industry providing strategies to consistently tackle these questions.

- **Project Groups.** We believe you'll be able to work at a more efficient pace if you are put into smaller study groups. This is different from your pair-programming partner. Within a project group, you will be talking about larger concepts such as Big-O, trees, graphs, talk about your life goals,and interview experience at various companies.

- **Pair-Programing Partner**. Your pair programming partner will help you with your communication style, your ability to "think out loud" and solve a problem. I recommend the following guide [Martin Fowler's blog post about pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)

- **Participation**. Attendance will be tracked in class. If you miss one day you are expected to cover the material for that day in your own time. 




## Communication

- **Course Communication - Us to You.** Any official course communication will be sent via Mattermost.

- **Course Communication - You to Us.** Generally, you should communicate to us via a Mattermost. You should feel safe to message us publicly about course schedules or anything that might not be clear. 

- **Office Hours & Mattermost.** I love the way Mattermost manages asynchronous communication, and it will always be where our metaphorical classroom is for this semester. However, there's also a lot of value in synchronous discussions- we will set aside 1 hour each day for Q&A in Zoom.

- **Class Routine.** You will show up to our morning standup where we will set the expectations for the day.

- **Feedback.** This class is highly experimental. We're eager to get feedback on it. Plus, giving feedback is an activity in your day to day as a technologist and Software Engineer. Please don't hesitate to give us feedback on what's working, what's not, what could be improved, and what should be emphasized more. You can post feedback to the Mattermost-channel or email (either publicly or privately), as well as include feedback in the several surveys we run during the course.

- **There are no stupid questions!** If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask them - chances are it's because we overlooked something. If you have any questions at all, please ask!
